Number Guessing Game in Java
This is a simple Java program for a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number.
The user is given feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

How to Play
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to enter a guess.
If the guess is too high, the program will display "Too high!".
If the guess is too low, the program will display "Too low!".
If the guess is correct, the program will display "Correct!" and the game will end.
The user can only guess for 5 times as there are only 5 attempts for guessing until they correctly guess the number.
